            Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or 
            speech-to-text, is a capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written format.

            The aim of this project is to build a deep learning model that is capable of transcribing a speech to text, 
            which should be accurate and robust against background noise.
            This will help The World Food Program to collect nutritional information of food bought and sold at markets in 
            three different countries in Africa - Ethiopia and Kenya. 
            
            This will be done in a sense that, selected people will 
            install a speech recognition's enabled app on their mobile phone, and whenever they buy food, they use their voice to 
            activate the app to register the list of items they just bought in their own language.
